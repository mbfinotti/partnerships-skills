# Skills for Partnership teams

> Partner ecosystem operations, from channel program design to creator payouts.

A collection of agent skills covering the full **partnerships** surface: channel and alliance strategy, co-selling policy, affiliate program mechanics, referral incentives, and influencer deals.

Built for **partner managers, BD leads, affiliate managers, and ecosystem heads** who own partner revenue.

Every skill produces a **decision-ready artifact**: a scorecard, a policy, a rate card, a signed-off spec, not a generic checklist.

**skills.sh (universal)**: works with any Agent Skills-compatible tool:

```bash
npx skills add mbfinotti/partnerships-skills
```

1. add as a plugin marketplace: open **Settings -> Capabilities -> Plugins**
